# lotto-game
Basic implementation of lotto game in vanilla javascript.
## Project description
This game simulates the italian lotto game.

The user can choose how many tickets he want to play and the bet (ambata - ambo - terno - quaterna -cinquina).
For each ticket the program calculates the numbers randomly and, then, simulates a fake extraction phase.

In the future I'd like to improve the application UI to make it more user friendly and I will handle more
user data entry errors.
